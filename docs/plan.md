### Sharp, high-impact moves to level-up **Perquire**

1. **Ship a dirt-simple “hello vector” CLI demo**
   *Problem*: first-time users bounce when they need to wire up a DB and creds.
   *Do*: `perquire demo --text "The quick brown fox"` pulls an OpenAI key from env, stores the embedding in an in-memory DuckDB, and walks through the 20-questions loop. Zero config, instant “aha”.

2. **Bundle a public benchmark**
   Pick 1–2 open datasets (e.g. STS-Benchmark, MS MARCO dev) and publish inversion accuracy + question-count charts vs. vec2text/TEIA.  Nothing fancy—just a reproducible notebook and a badge in the README.

3. **Expose a “pluggable interrogator” interface**
   Right now the Q-generator is hard-wired.  Abstract it (strategy pattern) so power users can drop in their own heuristics or use a local Llama-3.  Keeps you model-agnostic and attracts contributors.

4. **Add privacy-risk scoring**
   After each inversion attempt, compute BLEU / ROUGE / embedding-sim against any **ground-truth** text you have.  Emit a “leak risk ≥ X%” flag.  This turns a neat trick into a compliance tool.

5. **Make “explain-my-vector” a REST microservice**
   Tiny FastAPI wrapper with `/invert` and `/probe` endpoints.  Lets teams embed Perquire behind their own dashboards without touching Python.

6. **Kill the YAML graveyard**
   Your `configs/` folder is bloated with half-used settings.  Move defaults into code, load overrides from env vars, delete the rest.  Less surface, fewer “works on my machine” bugs.

7. **Swap Matplotlib for Plotly in the notebook**
   Interactive score curves and cosine-sim heatmaps make the iterative loop *feel* alive.  Users can hover to see which question caused which gain.

8. **Automate model drift alerts**
   Log the average similarity delta between daily production vectors and the embedding model’s moving mean.  If the distribution drifts, you ping Slack.

9. **License clarity**
   Right now you’re MIT *except* for the question templates, which cite GPT-4 output.  Either regenerate them with an open-weight model or dual-license—otherwise enterprise legal will balk.

10. **Roadmap transparency**
    A crisp `ROADMAP.md` with three milestones (MVP, 0.9, 1.0) is worth more than a Trello screenshot.  Helps outsiders decide where to jump in.

---

**Priority order:** 1 (demo) → 3 (pluggable interrogator) → 4 (privacy score) will give the biggest credibility bump with the least yak-shaving.  Nail those and you’re no longer “cool hack”—you’re a product.
